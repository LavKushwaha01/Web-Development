# Internal packages

Node.js provides you some `packages` out of the box. Some common ones include

1. fs - Filesystem
2. path - Path related functions
3. http - Create HTTP Servers (weâ€™ll discuss this tomorrow)

### fs package

The fs (Filesystem) package is used to read, write, update contents on the filesystem.

Why use the `path` library?

1. Cross platform joins (Windows has Users\kirat\dir , linux has Users/kirat/dir)
2. Gives you a bunch of helper functions (dirname)
3. Normalises paths (Converts `/Users/kirat/Proejcts/../../Projects` to `/Users/kirat/Projects`)
