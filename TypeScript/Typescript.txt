1st install typescript globally

by run command npm install typescript

then initalize typescript in your folder by run command
npx tsc --init

then in your directory create .ts file and for compiling it to js
use npx tsc -b command


tsconfig.json 

target section is version controller or which version our code is supporting

these two has to be added in tsconfig.json in compileroption section

 "rootDir": "./src",      indicate where is my ts file
    "outDir": "./dist",   show where js file has to be created 
    now add this dist to gitignore to avoid push js file in github

    noImplicitiley : true  means if not given datatype then any is not apply automaticaly if it false then if no any data type given then it's any
    it's true by default

    if removecomment set to true then js is created without comment of ts

    ********you can't create function with same name in a samne directory ******


    *** edit package.json as  script {"dev": "tsc -b  && node ./dist/index.js",} now by just "npm run dev" index.js will run
